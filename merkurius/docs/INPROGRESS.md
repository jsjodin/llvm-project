# In progress

Designs being worked out and the plans for carrying them out. When a
design is decided and implemented, it moves into the design document
(`MercuryMLIRCompilerandRuntimeDesign.md`). There it states what was chosen
and why the alternatives were rejected, with the measurements that decided
it, above all for how values are represented and how the collector works.
This file then keeps only what is still open.

## The order of the next pieces

Three chunks remain before processes and memory management are done: terms
on a heap, then processes and messaging, then garbage collection. The first
is shared: messaging needs terms (a message is a value of a user type,
`mailbox(M)` is polymorphic, `spawn` takes a closure, and `send` deep-copies
a term), and so does a collector, which traces them with the same layout
information. Messaging comes before collection: done with the invariants
below, it needs no rework when the collector arrives.

1. **Terms and allocation (shared foundation).** Constructors and lists,
   tagged pointers, polymorphism with `type_info`, closures, and all
   allocation through `mrt` operations with a heap-limit check from the
   start, even while the slow path only takes another chunk and never
   frees. The cell layout (Runtime system, "Memory management", options A
   and B) is decided here, so that neither messaging nor the collector has
   to change it later.
2. **Processes and messaging, leaking.** Per-process heaps as bump
   allocation into chunks, the scheduler and mailboxes, `send` copying into
   a fragment as the design has it, and preemption by lowering the heap
   limit, with `mrt.yield_check` in loops that do not allocate. Each process
   has a stack of a fixed size given at spawn, with the limit check on entry
   to procedures on cycles (Runtime system, "Processes and scheduler").
3. **Garbage collection.** Statepoints and stack maps, minor and major
   collection, the remembered set for destructive updates and the holes of
   last call modulo constructor, and received fragments as roots. A
   `!merk.ref` becomes the cell's pointer and the hole's offset, so that
   the cell is a base the statepoints relocate (design document, Lowering,
   "GC metadata and safepoints").

**Invariants that keep chunk 2 from being redone in chunk 3:**

- Every allocation goes through `mrt.alloc` and its limit check, so the
  collector hooks into the slow path.
- A mailbox handle is a value, never a pointer into another heap.
- A message lives in a fragment of its own, which the collector merges,
  rather than pointing across heaps.
- The runtime's C++ code holds no raw heap pointer across anything that
  could become a safepoint.

What the collector adds beyond that is statepoint lowering of calls, a
change to lowering that leaves messaging's design alone. Aliasing and open
terms are apart from all three: they are variable cells and the trail, and
messages can be ground terms at first.

## Chunk 1: terms and allocation

### Where it starts

(As of 2026-11-04, before step 1; steps 1 to 3 are done.) Code generation
handles primitive types, strings, `io.state` and arrays of word-sized
values. It reports as not yet implemented any other type
("values of type ..."), polymorphic procedures and calls with hidden
arguments, disjunctions, and unifications other than assignments and tests
of primitive values. The `merk` dialect has no term type and none of
`merk.construct`, `merk.deconstruct`, `merk.unify_test`, `merk.closure` or
`merk.call_closure`. There is no `mrt` dialect: `merk` lowers straight to
the LLVM dialect. Arrays are allocated by the runtime with `malloc` and
never freed. The library's array predicates are built into code generation
"until the library can be compiled with type_infos".

### Decisions to make

Each is decided before the step that depends on it. The design document
records the choice and the rejected options.

**D1. Cell layout. Decided 2026-11-04: headerless cells (option A),**
traced by type. The design document has the decision, the rejected header
word and pages of one shape, and experiment E7's numbers
(`experiments/layout`). Still to do: implement it in step 3, and measure
nrev again on our compiler in step 7.

**D2. Where the heap pointer and limit live.** Every allocation reads and
bumps them, and the scheduler lowers the limit to preempt.

- A thread-local current-process pointer. A process runs on one worker at a
  time, so the worker's thread-local is its process. It costs a TLS access
  per allocation, which LLVM may keep in a register within a function.
- A hidden context argument on every procedure, as GHC's BaseReg is in
  effect. One register, no TLS, but every call and closure carries it, and
  foreign code that calls back needs it.
- A pinned register: fastest, but it needs a calling convention per
  target, which LLVM supports only partly.

OpenMP favours the first: a team thread's thread-local is null until its
first allocation attaches it to the region's process (Runtime system,
"OpenMP cooperation"), where a hidden argument would have to pass through
outlined functions and a pinned register be set on each team thread.

To be decided with chunk 2's context switch in mind; the allocation fast
path is written so that only where the pair is read changes. Until then
(step 3) the pair is thread-local, `merk_heap` in `runtime/heap.cpp`, which
the first option's cost is, with a thread's heap where the first option
has a process's: only `mrt.alloc`'s lowering and `runtime/heap.h` read it.

**D3. `type_info` and type descriptors. Decided 2026-11-04,** with the tag
in the `type_info`, strong symbols for descriptors, and generated unify and
compare; moved into the design document with step 4.
The layout is ours: the manual's `type_info` and `pseudo_type_info` notions,
the RTTI paper (Dowd et al., 1999) and E4's observations are the references,
and Melbourne's representation is not copied (Clean-room rules).

*A descriptor* is static data, one for each type constructor, not for each
applied type, since a term's layout does not depend on its type arguments:

```c
struct MerkTypeCtor {
  uint8_t kind;           // below
  uint8_t flags;          // PointerFree, OpenSame, VariableArity
  uint16_t arity;         // type parameters
  uint32_t functorCount;
  const char *module, *name;
  MerkUnify unify;        // i1 (type_info, word, word)
  MerkCompare compare;    // i64 (type_info, word, word)
  const MerkFunctor *functors;   // in declaration order, compare's order
  uint16_t byTag[8];      // Cells: a primary tag's functor, or the shared mark
  const uint16_t *constants;     // Cells: a constant's number to its functor
  const uint16_t *shared;        // Cells: a secondary tag to its functor
};

struct MerkFunctor {
  const char *name;
  uint32_t arity;         // fields, without a secondary tag's word
  uint8_t tag;
  int32_t secondary;      // -1 if none
  int64_t constant;       // a constant's word
  const MerkFieldType *fields;
};
```

The kinds are the integers with their width and sign, `Float`, `Char`,
`String`, `Array`, `Dummy`, `Enum`, `NoTag`, `Cells`, `Tuple`, `Closure`
(D7), `TypeInfo` and `TypeclassInfo`, and later `Open` and `Closed`. A new
kind changes no existing descriptor. `PointerFree` means a value holds no
heap pointer if its type arguments hold none, so the tracer can skip it.

*A `type_info`* is one word, a pointer with a tag in its low bits:

| Tag | Points to | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | A descriptor, for a type of arity 0 | `int` |
| 1 | A cell: the descriptor, then its arguments' `type_info`s | `list(int)` |

A tuple's or closure's constructor (`VariableArity`) has the number of
arguments after the descriptor. A `type_info` with no type variables is a
static cell, one for each type in a module; `list(T)` in polymorphic code
is an allocated cell. Two `type_info`s of one type can have different
addresses, so `univ` and the like compare them by structure.

*A field's type* (`MerkFieldType`) is a word of the same form, with two more
tags: 2 for a type parameter of the term's type, its number in the high
bits, and 3 for an existential variable, whose `type_info` is in the cell's
hidden fields (design document, "Type descriptors"). So `[|]`'s fields are
`var 1` and the static cell `[list, var 1]`. A walker cannot allocate, least
of all the collector, so it does not make a `type_info` for each field: it
carries the field's type and a pointer to the frame that gives its
variables' `type_info`s.

*Finding a value's functor:* `Enum`, by the word; `NoTag`, no functor, the
same word at the argument's type; `Cells`, `byTag[word & 7]`, then with the
shared mark the secondary tag in the cell's first word, and with tag 0 and
constants in the type `constants[word >> 3]`. A cell's size is its functor's
arity, plus one for a secondary tag. That is all the collector and the
message copy need of the cell: they read no header.

*Unify and compare* in polymorphic code are `merk_unify(ti, x, y)`: load the
descriptor, whichever the tag, and tail call `unify` with the same
arguments. Lowering generates that entry for each type, which loads the
`type_info`s of the type's arguments and tail calls `unify.T`; `unify.T` for
`list(T)` takes `T`'s `type_info` and calls `merk_unify` on the heads. A
unification at a known type keeps calling the monomorphic `unify.T`
directly, as today, so monomorphic code does not change. `compare` follows
the same pattern. A type with user-defined equality has its predicate there.
The collector, the message copy, `from_open` and printing are walkers in
the runtime, in C++.

*Where descriptors live.* A strong symbol in the module that defines the
type, since a module importing an abstract type cannot make it. The
primitive types', arrays' and tuples' are `linkonce_odr` in each module using
them, not in the runtime as first proposed: their unify entries are `tailcc`
procedures, which C++ cannot define, and generating them keeps one path for
all. Until step 6 compiles `list`, `maybe` and `pair`, the same goes for the
uncompiled library's types, marked temporary. Nothing compares descriptors by
address, so a duplicate would be harmless.

*Words.* Polymorphic code requires that every value be one canonical word:
narrower integers and chars zero-extended, a float its bits, a dummy value 0.
Fields are so already (Type representation). Zero extension needs no
signedness, and a descriptor says how to compare the bits. `merk` gets
conversions between a value and its word at polymorphic calls and fields;
only the narrow types and floats generate code for them.

*Rejected:*

- **A descriptor that doubles as a `type_info`, told by its first word,**
  as the RTTI paper describes: testing needs a load, and mispredicts on a
  type mix, where the tag is known from the pointer. The paper itself
  has a switch to turn this off. Not measured; the choice is confined to
  `merk_unify` and the walkers, so it can be revisited at step 7's gate.
- **A descriptor per applied type,** which would hold each field's concrete
  type: polymorphic code would need to make them at run time, and they would
  be needed for every type used in a program.
- **Unify and compare as walkers only,** without generated procedures: less
  code, but slower on the path E4 measured at 3×, with no way to specialize
  or inline them, and user-defined equality has to call out anyway.
- **A generated trace procedure per type** in place of tables: possibly a
  faster collector, but more code per type, and the copy, printing and
  `from_open` need the tables anyway. It can be added beside them later.

*What open types need from this* (see "Open types", below):

- **One variable tag for every type.** `deref` and `bind` must not need a
  `type_info`, so tag 7 is the variable tag in every open layout. A type
  needing tag 7 in its ordinary layout moves one more functor under the
  shared tag in its open layout.
- **Whether the two layouts coincide is known only at run time** for
  `list(T)`: `T = tree` shares its layout, and `T = int` does not. `OpenSame`
  says a type's layouts coincide if its arguments' do, so that polymorphic
  `to_open` can decide from the `type_info`. Answering no for a type whose
  layouts do coincide only makes `to_open` copy.
- **An open layout is a fixed function of the ordinary descriptor,** so
  that the runtime can derive it for a type whose module never mentions
  `open`, which polymorphic code can receive. The design document's "each
  type used under `open(_)` gets a descriptor" cannot see such a type, and
  generating one for every type would charge programs that do not use open
  types, against the cost rule. Walkers therefore take a layout, ordinary or
  open, beside the descriptor.

**D4. Polymorphic arguments.** On 64-bit targets every value fits a word,
so a polymorphic argument is a word, a float its bits, with no boxes. mmc
does the same on 64 bits in `hlc.gc`: a `list(float)` built through a
polymorphic predicate takes the same memory as a `list(int)`, 16 bytes an
element, and its generated C's `MR_box_float` allocates nothing there
(measured 2026-11-04). 32-bit targets
would need boxes for `float`, `int64` and `uint64`; they are not
supported.

**D5. Which of Melbourne's optimizations to keep, and when.** From the
design document's table: enums as small integers, constants among
functors as tagged small integers, primary tags, the secondary tag
in the cell's first word, notag types and static ground terms, from the
start. Packed enum fields later, since they change field access, not the
dialect.

**D6. Static ground terms and the collector.** A ground term known at
compile time is a global (done in step 3). The collector must not copy it;
with headerless cells (D1) it knows by the address: a pointer outside the
process's heap chunks is static or a received fragment's.

**D7. Closure layout and calls.** Decided 2026-11-06 and done in step 5:
an entry shared by every closure of a procedure with as many captured
values, a lambda expression as a procedure of its own, and word copies for
tail calls (design document, Lowering, "Closures", with the rejected
alternatives).

### Steps

Each is a commit with its tests, run and output-checked as the existing
`test/CodeGen` tests are, with mmc's output where mmc can compile the
program.

1. **Done:** D1's measurement, in C, and the decision written into the design
   document with the rejected options.
2. **Done:** monomorphic types in `merk`. `!merk.term<"T">`,
   `merk.type_def`, `merk.construct`, `merk.deconstruct`,
   `merk.has_functor`, `merk.switch` on constructors, and unifications of
   terms as calls of a `unify.T` procedure generated for each type, in
   place of `merk.unify_test` (the design document has why). Enums,
   constants mixed with functors, notag types, tuples, and user types and
   `list(T)` at known `T`, lowered straight to LLVM, with cells from
   `merk_alloc`, a `malloc` that never frees. Left for later steps: static
   ground terms (step 3), unifications of terms with `string` or array
   arguments, and the library's `list`, `maybe` and `pair` predicates
   (step 6).
3. **Done:** the `mrt` dialect. `mrt.alloc` with a bump pointer and
   limit check, whose slow path is `merk_alloc_slow` in the runtime, taking
   chunks that are never freed; `mrt.tag`, `mrt.untag`,
   `mrt.primary_tag`, `mrt.field_load`, `mrt.field_store`, and D1's
   headerless cells. Terms lower through `mrt`, and the runtime's arrays
   allocate on the same heap. Static ground terms as globals (D6), one for
   each cell's contents. The heap pointer and limit are thread-local until
   D2. Left for chunk 3: arrays' element loads and stores as `mrt`
   operations, for the write barrier.
4. **Polymorphism.** Done: canonical words for narrow fields, hidden
   `type_info` arguments, polymorphic procedures on terms and arrays, and
   descriptors with their functor tables, generic `unify` and `compare`, and
   `io.write` and `io.print` as the first walker, declared in `io.m` as
   polymorphic `foreign_proc`s, and typeclass_infos, with direct calls of
   known instances (design document, Lowering, "Type classes"), and
   existentially typed predicates and functions, and existentially typed
   constructors, whose cells have their `type_info`s and `typeclass_info`s
   first (design document, Lowering, "Existentially typed constructors").
   A constrained variable whose `type_info` is only inside a constraint's
   argument's type is "not yet implemented". Cloning a polymorphic procedure for a known dictionary
   (Optimizations, "What polymorphism costs") and `pragma inline` are in no
   step yet. Types with polymorphic recursion, whose instances
   have no end, such as `grow(T) ---> stop(T) ; more(T, grow(list(T)))`, are
   "not yet implemented" too.
   Values of an abstract imported type are still "not yet
   implemented": a module cannot pass one without its layout, as a notag
   float travels in a float register.
5. **Done:** closures. `merk.closure`, `merk.closure_word` and
   `merk.call_closure` (D7), lambda expressions, closures of named and
   built-in procedures, higher-order calls in constant stack through word
   copies, `pred/N` and `func/N` type_infos, and `io.write_list` (design
   document, Lowering, "Closures"). Left: closures of methods, tail calls through imported procedures' closures,
   `io.write_list` to a stream; the library's other higher-order
   predicates, such as `int.fold_up`, come with step 6.
6. **The library on terms.** `list`, `maybe` and `pair` compiled, and the
   array predicates compiled with `type_info`s instead of built into code
   generation; `io.command_line_arguments`, which needs lists. In five
   commits: (a) `require`, and `-fstub-unimplemented` for the library's
   build; (b) `pair` and `maybe`; (c) `list`; (d) the array predicates;
   (e) `io.command_line_arguments`. Done: (a), (b), (c). (d) and (e) wait for
   the code generation that comes before them (below), so that `list` is
   written plainly, with every mode working, rather than around stubs;
   (c) came once clauses for one mode and nondeterminism worked, before
   the collection of all solutions, which needs it.

   *Temporary, until code generation makes every procedure of the library*
   (decided 2026-11-06): the library's build passes `-fstub-unimplemented`,
   with which a procedure whose body code generation cannot make, such as a
   nondet mode of `list.member`, gets a body that calls the runtime's
   `merk_not_implemented`, which reports it and exits with status 1, rather
   than failing the module; one without a signature code generation can
   make is left out, as no call of it can be generated either. Rejected: leaving them all out,
   which a path to one would make a link error rather than a message; and
   removing the nondet and multi modes from the library's interfaces, which
   would make programs that mmc accepts mode errors. Also temporary:
   `require.report_lookup_error`, whose message needs the key's type name
   and a writer to the standard error, says it is not implemented.
7. **The gate.** nrev at E1's sizes on our compiler against E1's C and
   mmc, and the design document's sections on representation, the calling
   convention and the `merk` and `mrt` operations updated.

Not in chunk 1: the collector.

### Before the rest of step 6: code generation's gaps

Decided 2026-11-06: code generation's gaps come before the rest of the
library and the gate, so that the library is not written around them and
the design has longer to be tested; working around them, as stubs or
library code written for what code generation can make, would be undone
later. In this order, each its own commit or commits:

1. **Disjunctions and nondeterminism,** by continuation passing (design
   document, Lowering, "Nondeterministic code"): first disjunctions that
   bind nothing used after them, and those in committed-choice contexts,
   which become chains of if-then-elses; then nondet and multi procedures
   and calls, through success continuations that return `i1` "stop"; then
   commits, where one solution of a nondet goal is wanted, in `cc_multi`
   calls, conditions, negations and the collection of all solutions; then
   nondet lambda expressions, closures, methods and word copies. Done:
   disjunctions with at most one solution or in committed-choice contexts,
   and `cc_nondet` procedures; nondet and multi procedures, their calls,
   disjunctions, switches and if-then-elses with more than one solution,
   commits in committed choice procedures and goals with no outputs,
   conditions with more than one solution (soft cuts), and nondet and
   multi lambda expressions, closures and higher-order calls. Next, in
   lock step with the library they need (decided 2026-11-06): clauses for
   one mode (item 2) and `list` (step 6 (c)), then last call modulo
   constructor, at every optimization level, so that `list` runs on long
   lists as mmc's does (design document, Lowering, "Deterministic and
   semidet code", "Last call modulo constructor"), all done; then the
   collection of all solutions, whose `solutions/2` sorts with `list`; then nondet methods
   and word copies of nondet procedures, which are reported as not yet
   implemented.

   **Collecting all solutions** (decided 2026-11-06). The library's
   `solutions` module is written in Mercury on one builtin that pure
   Mercury cannot express, carrying an accumulator across backtracking:
   `builtin_aggregate(Generator, Step, Acc0, Acc)`, which code generation
   makes `merk.aggregate`, whose generator's solutions go to a region that
   takes each with the accumulator and gives the next. Outlining keeps the
   accumulator in a slot of an environment in the caller's frame, as a
   soft cut's flag, which the continuation updates before it asks for the
   next solution. `solutions/2` sorts with `list.sort_and_remove_dups`,
   written in Mercury on `compare`. Rejected: `solutions.m` in plain
   Mercury on a mutable heap cell updated by impure `foreign_proc`s in a
   failure-driven loop, which needs no compiler construct but allocates
   a cell for each collection, updates the heap destructively, which the
   collector's write barrier must then see, and needs
   `unsafe_promise_unique` for accumulators in `di`/`uo` modes.
2. **What mode analysis does not check yet,** which code generation now
   reports: clauses for one mode, trace goals, and `try` and `atomic`
   goals. Done: clauses for one mode, taken before the collection of all
   solutions (decided 2026-11-06), as `list` needs them for modes such as
   `reverse(out, in)`, and `solutions/2` needs `list`. Next: trace goals,
   `try` and `atomic` goals, after the rest of item 1.
3. **Open types,** `open(T)` and `closed(T)` (below): the `any` inst,
   variable cells and the trail. After nondeterminism, as backtracking
   undoes a binding through the trail.
4. **Exceptions,** `throw` and `catch` with `invoke` and landing pads
   (design document, Lowering, "Exceptions"), which also undo through the
   trail.
5. **Polymorphism's leftovers:** calls with hidden arguments, existential
   types in methods, closures and `foreign_proc`s, closures of methods,
   and unifications of terms with `string` or array arguments.

Then steps 6 (d), (e) and 7; (c), `list`, came within item 1, before the
collection of all solutions. `-fstub-unimplemented` goes when the library
needs it no longer.

## Open types: `closed(T)`

Decided 2026-11-04: `closed(T)` comes with open types, not after them. It
lets a type say which parts are open, where `open(T)` alone is deep: every
argument at every depth becomes open, so filling a hole with a large ground
value means `to_open` on all of it, a copy if it has raw fields, and
`from_open` copying it back.

```mercury
:- type bundle ---> bundle(closed(big), closed(big), closed(big)).

    % open(bundle): a field may be unbound, but once bound holds a ground big.
Hole = closed(Chunk)    % one small box holding the pointer; Chunk is not touched
```

`closed(T)` is a library type, `:- type closed(T) ---> closed(T).`, so
outside `open(_)` it is a notag type: `T`'s word, at no cost. Under `open(_)`:

| Where | What changes |
| --- | --- |
| Type checker | `closed(T)`'s argument under `open(_)` stays `T` |
| Mode analysis | That argument is `ground`, under inst `any` |
| Open layout | A one-word box of `T`'s word, with no descent into `T` |
| Descriptors | The constructor's kind is `Closed`; no other field is needed |
| `to_open`, `from_open` | Add or remove the box; the value is shared |
| Unification | Both bound: `T`'s ordinary unify; the occurs check stops there |
| Collector, message copy, printing | The walker changes to the ordinary layout there |

Ground code, the heap and the trail do not change. A bound hole is a write
into an older cell, so it needs the remembered set, as every `bind` does.

- **`closed(open(U))`** cannot be ruled out in polymorphic code. The mode rule
  covers it, since a value with unbound variables is not `ground`, and the
  walker follows the `type_info`, back to the open layout.
- **A unique value put in `closed(T)` becomes shared,** so it can no longer be
  updated in place.
- **A message still copies the value:** `closed(T)` saves the copies inside a
  process. A hole cannot be filled from another process either, since open
  values are sent as `copy_term` does, so the process holding the hole binds it.
- **Not for building in order.** `foo(bundle(X, Y, Z)) :- recv(X), recv(Y),
  recv(Z).` needs neither: mode analysis constructs the bundle after the
  receives (checked with merkc and mmc), and values arriving in any order
  fit an ordinary term of `maybe`s. `closed(T)` is for a term that something
  must hold while it is still incomplete.
